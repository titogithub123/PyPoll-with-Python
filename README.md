# PyPoll-with-Python
## Analyzing Election Results in the State of Colorado.
### Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of the analysis was to determine the results of a recent election in three specific counties in the State of Colorado. We were able to implement our new found skills using the python programming language to run calculations and iterate over our raw data to determine a few of the following metrics. 

```
- The voter turnout for each county.
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
- The county with the highest turnout.
```

In addition, thanks to the work that we have completed we were also able to determine the ultimate winner of the election, taking into account the winning vote count and also the winning percentage.
