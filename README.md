# PyPoll-with-Python
## Analyzing Election Results in the State of Colorado.
### Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of the analysis was to determine the results of a recent election in three specific counties in the State of Colorado. We were able to implement our new found skills using the python programming language to run calculations and iterate over our raw data to determine a few of the following metrics. 

```
- The voter turnout for each county.
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
- The county with the highest turnout.
```

In addition, thanks to the work that we have completed we were also able to determine the ultimate winner of the election, taking into account the winning vote count and also the winning percentage. 

### Election Audit Results
One of the very first calculations we wanted to determine was the amount of total votes cast in the election. Based on this information we would then be able to dive deeper into the data to determine the rest of the metrics we wanted to answer. In order to make our work as efficent as possible we used a 'For' loop to iterate over the data and add together all the ballots cast.
